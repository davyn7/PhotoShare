# PhotoShare

## Description
Built a photo sharing app for my CS 142 Final Project. This app is a simplified version of Instagram, allowing users to upload, like, and comment on photos. Used React for the front end and MongoDB (Mongoose) for the backend.

## Details and features (all supported by both the frontend and backend):
- User register, login, and logout
- User delete, which not only deletes their account page, but also the likes and comments they have left on other users' photos
- User upload and delete photos
- User like and unlike photos, sorting photos by like count
- User upload, like, and delete comments on photos
- User activity feed, displaying the last five user actions
